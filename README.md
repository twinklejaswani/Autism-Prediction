# AutismPrediction

This project focuses on predicting Autism which is a serious developmental disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and interact. The data sets used are related to the patients details in the form of text containing the detailed explanation of the symptoms from which they are suffering.  The data sets contain details of both, patients with Autism and without Autism so as to train with both kinds of instances. This project uses Weka for pre-processing the data and SVM classifier for training the predictive model.
